Code implementation for our paper "Decentralized Routing and Radio Resource Allocation in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks via Graph Reinforcement Learning"

While the main function of training loop is in `run.py`, you should take `exp_queue.py` as the main file to run. It calls `run.py` with various setups and collects results of multiple experiments (candidates). These results can be finally visualized to curves in the figures from the manuscript.

The reference to our paper is 

X. Zhang et al., "Decentralized Routing and Radio Resource Allocation in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks via Graph Reinforcement Learning," in IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking, doi: 10.1109/TCCN.2024.3360517.

If you have any questions, please contact me. I would try to offer help as long as I can.
